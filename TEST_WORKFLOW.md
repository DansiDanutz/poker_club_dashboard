- ✅ **Total Sessions**: Should show `1`
- ✅ **Last Played**: Should show today's date
- ✅ **Last Session**: Should show the duration

**Check Session History:**

- Each entry should have: Player name, Date, Duration, Seat In/Out times

**Check Promotion Stats:**
- In the Promotions section, the test promotion should show:
  - Updated hours played
  - Updated session count  
  - Updated unique players count
